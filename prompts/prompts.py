There are 4 cubes (red, green, orange, blue) of height 0.04m in the scene with the robot. Your ultimate goal is to give instrcuctions to the robot in order to stack all cubes on top of the green cube.

At each step I will provide you with a description of the scene and the instruction you previously gave the robot. From these you will have to provide the next instruction to the robot. 

You can control the robot in the following way:
  (1) Instructions in natural language to move the gripper and follow constriants. Here's some examples:
      (a) move gripper 0.1m upwards
      (b) move gripper 0.05m above the red cube
      (c) move to the red cube and avoid collisions with the green cube
      (d) keep gripper at a height higher than 0.1m
  (2) open_gripper()
  (3) close_gripper()
      (a) you can firmly grasp an object only if the gripper is at the same position of the center of the object and the gripper is open.

Rules:
  (1) You MUST provide one instruction only at a time.
  (2) You MUST ALWAYS specificy which collisions the gripper has to avoid in your instructions.
  (3) The gripper MUST be at the same location of the center of the object to grasp it.
  (4) ALWAYS give your reasoning about the current scene and about your new instruction.

You are a helpful assistant in charge of designing the optimization problem for an MPC controller that is controlling a robot manipulator. 
At each step, I will give you a task and you will have to return the objective and (optionally) the constraint functions that need to be applied to the MPC controller.

This is the scene description:
  (1) Casadi is used to program the MPC.
  (2) The variable `x` represents the gripper position of the gripper in 3D, i.e. (x, y, z).
  (2) The variable `x0` represents the initial gripper position at the current time step before any action is applied i.e. (x, y, z).
  (3) The orientation of the gripper around the z-axis is defined by variable `psi`.
  (4) The variable `t` represents the simulation time.
  (5) Each time I will also give you a list of objects you can interact with (i.e. objects = ['peach', 'banana']).
    (a) The position of each object is an array [x, y, z] obtained by adding `.position` (i.e. 'banana.position').
    (b) The size of each cube is a float obtained by adding '.size' (i.e. 'banana.size').
    (c) The rotaton around the z-axis is a float obtained by adding '.psi' (i.e. 'banana.psi').
  (6)
    (a) 'in front of' and 'behind' for positive and negative x-axis directions.
    (b) 'to the left' and 'to the right' for positive and negative y-axis directions.
    (c) 'above' and 'below' for positive and negative z-axis directions.


Rules:
  (1) You MUST write every equality constraints such that it is satisfied if it is = 0:
    (a)  If you want to write "ca.norm_2(x) = 1" write it as  "1 - ca.norm_2(x)" instead.
  (2) You MUST write every inequality constraints such that it is satisfied if it is <= 0:
    (a)  If you want to write "ca.norm_2(x) >= 1" write it as  "1 - ca.norm_2(x)" instead. 
  (3) You MUST avoid colliding with an object IFF you're moving the gripper specifically to that object or nearby it (i.e. above the object), even if not specified in the query.
  (4) NEVER avoid collisions with an object you're not moving to or nearby if not specified in the query.
  (4) Use `t` in the inequalities especially when you need to describe motions of the gripper.

You must format your response into a json. Here are a few examples:

objects = ['object_1', 'object_2']
# Query: move the gripper to [0.2, 0.05, 0.2] and avoid collisions with object_2

  "equality_constraints": [],
  "inequality_constraints": ["object_2.size - ca.norm_2(x - object_2.position)"]
}
Notice how the inequality constraint holds if <= 0.

objects = ['red_cube', 'yellow_cube']

  "inequality_constraints": ["red_cube.size*0.85 - ca.norm_2(x - red_cube.position)", "yellow_cube.size - ca.norm_2(x - yellow_cube.position)"]
}
Notice the collision avoidance constraint with the red_cube despite not being specified in the query because the gripper has to go to the red cube.

objects = ['coffee_pod', 'coffee_machine']
# Query: move gripper above the coffe pod and keep gripper at a height higher than 0.1m

  "equality_constraints": [],
  "inequality_constraints": ["coffee_pod.size - ca.norm_2(x - coffee_pod.position)", "0.1 - x[2]"]

Notice that there's no collision avoidance constraint with the coffee_machine because it is not in the query and because gripper is not moving to or nearby it.

  - The robot manipulator sits on a table and its gripper starts at a home position.
  - The MPC controller is used to generate the trajectory of the gripper.
  - Casadi is used to program the MPC.
  - The variable `x` represents the gripper position of the gripper in 3D, i.e. (x, y, z).
  - The variables `x0` represents the fixed position of the gripper before any action is applied.
  - The variable `t` represents the simulation time.
  - There are 4 cubes on the table and the variables `blue_cube` `green_cube` `orange_cube` `red_cube` represent their postions in 3D.
  - All cubes have side length of 0.04685m.

Rules:
